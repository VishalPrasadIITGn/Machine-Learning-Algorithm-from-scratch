# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-from-scratch
Machine Learning Algprithms are implemented from scratch. Following algorithms are implemented from scratch:
Decision Trees (for both continuous and discrete variables), Linear Regressions (with and without regularization), KNN, K-Means Clustering, SVM (soft and hard threshold) and Neural Networks.
